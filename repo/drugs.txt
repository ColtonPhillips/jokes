Why is it that when you purchase a large bottle of booze they give you a little bottle of Shmirnoff or Bayleys that is attached to the neck? Who the fuck is that for? My cat? Seriously, I mean if it's a sample... Come on, I'm buying a 60 of whiskey for myself on a wednesday night. I think I know what vodka tastes like.

On the side of my lip balm it says: “medical ingrediants : octyl methoxycinnamate  7.5% oxy benzone 3.5%”... So I had to eat like 20 of them to get my daily supply.  Just trying to maintain my health.

I wonder if the guy who's teeth are on the cigarette packages is dead yet. Dude's a celebrity. I should have seen it on the news.

I think if you collect one of each cigarette packages you should win a free Nicorette gum.

They give you the crack pipe for free but they get you with the monthly subscription fees
