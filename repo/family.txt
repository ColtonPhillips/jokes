I was eating at Humpty's, and a father was eating with his son at the next table. The father asks, "How are your pancakes son?"  He replies, "They taste good", to which the father firmly says, "No son. They taste serendipitous."

When I was younger I gave my grandmother Christmas ornaments for Christmas.  But now that I really think about it, I probably shouldn't have.  I mean it is already fucking Christmas.  She won't even be able give the shitty angel a real try for a whole fucking year, and when that day comes she just gets a new damn ornament and the cycle starts all over again.  What was I thinking? 

My brother went to deaf camp because he likes rope climbing and people yelling shit at him.
