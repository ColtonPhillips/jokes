I once saw a commercial for a hotel that said, "Come in and experience our legendary quality service".  I'm not saying the service is bad, but maybe legendary is a little much. Was the complimentary breakfast passed down through the Kings and Queens for generations, sought after by all those who seen it and prepared to be eaten by only the chosen one with the mark of a god? No. So maybe the service is just "really good".

I once saw a commercial for antidepressants where it said that two of the side effects of the drugs are urge to gamble and unusual sexual arousal.  You get extremely horny, lose all your money at blackjack so you can't afford to pay for the hooker your horny pilled up ass so desperately craves.  Aren't the side effects worse than the depression?  Besides those side effects are so random they don't even make any sense.  It's like if you took some halls for a cold and you had an unusual craving to beat someone to death with a cue ball sock.

I was watching an advertisement for a high definition television on my standard definition set. The television looked very clear and vivid on my television, so I guess I don't need to buy one.

The new laundry detergent ads are all about how the solution is more concentrated and in a smaller bottle. All that means is that you're no longer watering it down. Although I appreciate the honesty about how you were ripping us all off for decades, What I'd really appreciate is if you kept it in the same sized bottle so your dumbass commercial actually meant something. Higher concentration, Less volume... same amount of cleany stuff. It doesn't take a mathematician to guesstimate this equation.
